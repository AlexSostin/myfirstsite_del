                        <p class="card-text">Paris, often referred to as the “City of Light”, is a city that never fails to enchant, whether under the soft whispers of the twilight or the shimmering glow of the midday sun. Home to iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and the charming Montmartre district, it’s a city that blends the allure of history with the pulse of contemporary life. The Seine River, flowing with a gentle rhythm, mirrors the city’s elegance. Paris is not just a city, it’s a world waiting to be explored.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Rome, the “Eternal City”, is a mesmerizing blend of cosmopolitan city life and rich historical heritage. Walking through Rome is like stepping into a time machine, with ancient ruins such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and the Pantheon standing as proud reminders of the city’s glorious past. Yet, Rome is not stuck in its history.
                            The city buzzes with vibrant cafes, bustling markets, and cutting-edge fashion. Rome’s cuisine, from its signature pasta dishes to its gelato, is a delightful experience for the senses.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Barcelona, the jewel of Catalonia, is a city where the avant-garde and the traditional collide.
                            Known for its architectural wonders, Barcelona is home to some of the most stunning works of the renowned architect Antoni Gaudí, including the Sagrada Familia and Park Güell. The city’s Gothic Quarter, with its narrow medieval streets, offers a stark contrast to the modernist Eixample district. Barcelona’s food scene, with its tapas bars and seafood paellas, is as lively and diverse as the city itself. From its sun-kissed beaches to its bustling La Rambla, Barcelona is a city that thrives on diversity and celebrates life.</p>
